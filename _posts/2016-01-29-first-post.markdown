Welcome one and all (probably one) to my first blog post.

My name is Nick and I'm a front-end web developer, or a least trying to be, from the UK. I'm orignally from London, but am currently living in Leeds (Leeds, Leeds...). 

This blog is primarily an outlet to keep me focused on learning new skills and as an ongoing project. So I'm essentially talking to myself, but if anyone else reads this then that's a bonus.
